***************** DIRECTORY STRUCTURE **************************************

This release contains the following directories:
* html             : contains documentation (html/index.html)
* src              : contains the source files

***************** BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ***************************************

I use the great application "kdevelop" to edit and build my source code, but if
you want to build the source code manually, this is how kdevelop does it:

Start in the main shout directory and type:
------------------------------------------
gmake -f Makefile.cvs
mkdir release
cd release
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -funroll-loops -march=pentium4 -malign-double -mfpmath=sse -msse -msse2" ../configure
gmake -j1

Or you can execute the ./configure-make.sh script in the main directory.

***************** DOCUMENTATION ********************************************

You can find the documentation in the HTML directory. For any questions that the documentation
does not answer please email me at: marijn.huijbregts@gmail.com
